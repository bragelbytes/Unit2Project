# Unit2Project

:::::::::dotPhotomode:::::

The intention of this project is to create a space where people can share and discuss photos they take in video games.

I used some of my own photos and some simple descriptions to seed in data to get it started.

This project was built using full CRUD. The user can create, edit, view, and delete posts.

I really wanted a comment section and this was something I struggled with greatly but luckily got help from fellow students and was able to get some basic commenting functionality. I would have liked to display the current users name along with the comments so that is something I will have to come back to.

Another area where I struggled was getting a proper "like" button to work. I was able to have empty heart containers when there is zero likes as well as a "heart this?" toggle my SHOW route, however I couldn't get the two to communicate properly nor could I get the Heart to change.

Overall, I am happy I got MVP plus a little extra but this is definitely one I want to come back to with a bit more knowledge and really make this something that would be fun for other video game photo hobbyists.
